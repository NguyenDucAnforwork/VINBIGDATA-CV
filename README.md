With a focus on speed, accuracy, and ease of use, FIRE is perfect for developers, researchers, and creatives looking to elevate their image processing workflows. Dive in and experience the future of image resolution enhancement today!

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2treesan/FIRE
cd FIRE
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the main script with your configurations:

```bash
python main.py \
    loader.hr_dir="<path_to_hr>" \
    loader.lr_dir="<path_to_lr>" \
    model="<model_name>" \
    trainer.epochs=100 \
    # Add other configurations as needed
```

- Replace `<path_to_hr>` and `<path_to_lr>` with the paths to your high-resolution and low-resolution datasets respectively. Note that each HR image must have a corresponding LR image with the same name.
- Replace `<model_name>` with the model defined in the `src/model` directory.

## Available Models

- **EDSRLite**: A lightweight version of the Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution network, optimized for faster performance while maintaining high-quality results.
